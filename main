# Super simple password hashing script written in Python 3 by David Gilmore, 2023.

# begin by importing any modules required
import bcrypt

# Ask the user for their password
password = input("What is your password?: ")

# Encode the password and salt as bytes
password_bytes = password.encode('utf-8')
salt = bcrypt.gensalt()

# Display the hashed password and salt
hashed = bcrypt.hashpw(password_bytes, salt)
print("Here's your hash: ")
print(hashed.decode('utf-8'))
